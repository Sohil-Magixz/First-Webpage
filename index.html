                Life in Night City is a complex tapestry of high-tech wonders and gritty realities. Here, cybernetic enhancements are commonplace, with individuals modifying their bodies with cyberware for improved abilities and appearance. The city pulses with energy, its streets alive with the hum of hovercars and the glow of neon signs. Yet, beneath the surface glamour lies a dark underbelly of crime and corruption. Gangs vie for territory, while mega-corporations wield immense power, often at the expense of the city's inhabitants. Despite the dangers, Night City is a place of opportunity for those willing to take risks, offering a chance to climb the social ladder or carve out a niche in its unforgiving streets. It's a world where one's humanity can feel tenuous, as the allure of technology clashes with the raw, unyielding essence of what it means to be human.

- Jackie Welles: V's loyal friend and partner, whose fate early in the game sets the tone for the story.
